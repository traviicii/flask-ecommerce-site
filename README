## Usage
This is an e-commerce site, allowing users to create accounts, sign in, and buy items.

## Contributors

Travis made the entire models.py, and getting the server routing set up so that the database stores/saves the users information, and if that user was an admin or not.
Daniel did the majority of the styling, he also worked on some of the routes.py in both the auth folder and non auth routes.py
They both did a good amount of displaying the correct information to the user!
